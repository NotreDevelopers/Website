                is a club where people can learn about video game design and development and,
                if they have enough interest, practice one of the many skills involved (game design,
                3D modelling, graphic design, programming, music, etc) and use those skills to create
                games, as individuals or in groups.  The club hopes to sponsor game-related events
                (lectures, game jams, conference trips, etc), provide members with hardware and
                software for game development (VR equipment, game engines, servers, etc), and
                increase the presence of video games as a relevant form of media on Notre Dame’s campus.</p>

                        <p>Levi is a Junior, studying Physics with minors in Computer Science and Japanese.
                           Beyond NotreDevelopers, he works as a camp counselor for Camp Kesem ND, leads
                           and helps out with various groups in Zahm House (his dorm), and is employed by
                           the university as a Peer Advisor.</p>
                        <p>In his free time, Levi enjoys reading fantasy novels, watching TV with his roommates,
                            practicing guitar, and (of course) playing video games. He likes all sizes and shapes
                            of games, but some of his favorite games are Bioshock, The Legend of Zelda, and Ratchet
                            & Clank.  He hopes his experiences through NDevs will show him whether a future career

                        <p>Sean's interest in video game development started in high school when he taught
                           himself Objective-C to make iPhone games. From there, he moved onto website

                           to continue exploring other programming languages. Video games are a fun pastime
