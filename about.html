                        <p><b>Levi Biasco</b> - President</p>
                        <p>Levi is a Junior, studying Physics with minors in Computer Science and Japanese.
                           Beyond NotreDevelopers, he works as a camp counselor for Camp Kesem ND, leads
                           and helps out with various groups in Zahm House (his dorm), and is employed by
                           the university as a Peer Advisor.</p>
                        <p>Levi was born in Pennsylvania but raised in Minnesota. In his free time, Levi
                           enjoys reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, tinkering on his computer, watching
                           TV with his roommates, practicing guitar, and (of course) playing video games.
                           He likes all sizes and shapes of games, but some of his favorite games are Bioshock,
                           The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask, and Ratchet & Clank.  He hopes his experiences
                           through NDevs will show him whether a future career in video game development
                           is a possibility.</p>

                        <p><b>Paul Kwak</b> - Vice-President</p>
                        <p>Paul is a Sophomore studying Computer Science, residing in Dunne Hall (the newest
                           dorm on campus). He’s lived by ND his entire life, a.k.a a townie.</p>
                        <p>Paul loves a variety of games, but he especially likes 2D platformers, shooters,
                           and RTS games. Also, he likes indie games such as Limbo, Ori and the Blind Forest,
                           and Dead by Daylight. He is excited to start this new journey, and can’t wait to
                           see where it takes him and everyone else.</p>

                        <p>Andy is a Junior studying Computer Science and Physics, and is a resident of Knott
                           Hall. Born and raised in the Chicagoland area, he currently resides in Colorado.</p>
                        <p>Beyond schoolwork, Andy enjoys working on his own projects and travelling. Some
                           of his favorite video game related projects include a brick breaker style game
                           and a Flappy Bird clone.  His favorite aspect of video game development is working
                           on the mechanics of the game.  Some of his favorite video games include Destiny
                           and Skyrim, as well as much simpler games such as 2048.</p>

                        <p><b>Sean Keenan</b> - Webmaster</p>
                        <p>Sean is a Senior studying Chemical Engineering. He is off campus this year but
                           was a proud resident of Siegfried Hall and is from the north suburbs of Chicago.
                           He loves boating, swimming, reading sci-fi and watching movies.</p>
                        <p>Sean's interest in video game development started in high school when he taught
                           himself Objective-C to make iPhone games. From there, he moved onto website
                           development but his project experience in research labs and class has allowed him
                           to continue exploring other programming languages. Video games are a fun pastime
                           for him and some of his favorites include Minecraft, Call of Duty, and Battlefront.</p>
