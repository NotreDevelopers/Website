                is a club where people can learn about video game design and development and,
                if they have enough interest, practice one of the many skills involved (game design,
                3D modelling, graphic design, programming, music, etc) and use those skills to create
                games, as individuals or in groups.  The club hopes to sponsor game-related events
                (lectures, game jams, conference trips, etc), provide members with hardware and
                software for game development (VR equipment, game engines, servers, etc), and
                increase the presence of video games as a relevant form of media on Notre Dame’s campus.</p>

                        <p>Levi is a Junior, studying Physics with minors in Computer Science and Japanese.
                           Beyond NotreDevelopers, he works as a camp counselor for Camp Kesem ND, leads
                           and helps out with various groups in Zahm House (his dorm), and is employed by
                           the university as a Peer Advisor.</p>
                        <p>In his free time, Levi enjoys reading fantasy novels, watching TV with his roommates,
                            practicing guitar, and (of course) playing video games. He likes all sizes and shapes
                            of games, but some of his favorite games are Bioshock, The Legend of Zelda, and Ratchet
                            & Clank.  He hopes his experiences through NDevs will show him whether a future career
                            in video game development is a possibility.</p>

                           dorm on campus). He’s lived by ND his entire life, a.k.a a townie.</p>
                        <p>Paul loves a variety of games, but he especially likes 2D platformers, shooters,
                           and RTS games. Also, he likes indie games such as Limbo, Ori and the Blind Forest,
                           and Dead by Daylight. He is excited to start this new journey, and can’t wait to
                           see where it takes him and everyone else.</p>

                           of his favorite video game related projects include a brick breaker style game
                           and a Flappy Bird clone.  His favorite aspect of video game development is working
                           on the mechanics of the game.  Some of his favorite video games include Destiny
                           and Skyrim, as well as much simpler games such as 2048.</p>

                        <p>Sean is a Senior studying Chemical Engineering. He is off campus this year but

                           He loves boating, swimming, reading sci-fi and watching movies.</p>
                        <p>Sean's interest in video game development started in high school when he taught
                           himself Objective-C to make iPhone games. From there, he moved onto website
                           development but his project experience in research labs and class has allowed him
                           to continue exploring other programming languages. Video games are a fun pastime
                           for him and some of his favorites include Minecraft, Call of Duty, and Battlefront.</p>
