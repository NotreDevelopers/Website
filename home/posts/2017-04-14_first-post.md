#First Post
Hey, everybody!

Welcome to the brand-spanking new NDevs website! We haven't quite finished everything yet, but we hope that enough is in place for us to work smoother as a club, both for our members and anybody who wants to learn more about us. In that vein, if you have any recommendations on what we could add/change, send us an email at <a href="mailto:ndevs@nd.edu?subject=Website Suggestion">ndevs@nd.edu</a>.

Now, for a breakdown of the different webpages our site has to offer...

<a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~ndevs/"><h2>Home</h2></a>
<p>As you've probably seen since this is our opening page, the "Home" page is for letting you know our big announcements, current club projects, and upcoming events. Hopefully nothing messes us too much, but there may be some weird things with the Next Event section. (Also, we'll get the Club Project section up as soon as we finish the "Projects" page!) On the right, which you might be looking at right now, is the Announcements section. Their listed in order of most recent, and if you want to check out previous announcements, scroll down and hit the right-arrow! ...well, after we get four or so announcements, when we'll need the right arrow.</p>

<a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~ndevs/projects.html"><h2>Projects</h2></a>
<p>I'll be straight with you, we haven't finished this page yet. It might be the most important one to us, since it could act as our hub for collaboration on group projects as well as our main method of showcasing our previous works. So what we plan for the page to do is list out all projects created through this club (whether club, group, or individual, based on whether the creators want to be listed), give details of who worked on what for the project (e.g. Art Lead, Composer, etc.), and hopefully give access to the games for anybody to try out.</p>

<a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~ndevs/resources.html"><h2>Resources</h2></a>
<p>In the "Resources" page, we try to list out as many useful and important game development tools, assets, websites, etc. as we can. So when you want to try making a game but don't know where to find the tools to do so, you can try looking through our lists! However, always remember that we don't have everything listed, and Google Is Your Friend. Also, probably the most important part of this page is specifically the asset banks. You can use these during your game development either as placeholders or the real deal, usually cutting out a large chunk of the asset creation time. (If you have any tools, asset sites, or other things that you would recommend, send them our way!)</p>

<a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~ndevs/about.html"><h2>About</h2></a>
<p>If you want to learn a little more about us as a club, some of our members and officers, and how to get connected with us, come to the "About" page. The most important part of this page is probably the links redirecting to some platforms we use as a club, Slack (general communication) and GitHub (version control and code hub). There are directions on how you can signup and join our club groups, too.</p>

That's about it. If you made it to this part, thanks for reading, and if you're not involved yet, we'd love to have you! Check out our meeting times on the "About" page or the Welcome statement on the "Home" page. Hope to see you soon!
