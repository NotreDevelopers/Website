Come join us for our very first video game tourney! As you can read above, the game is Super Smash Bros. Melee, and the rules will be based on other competitive tournaments. (But don't worry; casual Smash players are more than welcome!) Come to the McNeill Room in Lafortune Student Center any time between 6pm and 6:50pm to sign up for the competition, and the main event starts at 7pm. Feel free to stick around and practice before that, as well as afterwards! Oh, and there will be food, so isn't that enough reason to come?

The prize will be a portion of the entry fees, and the rules will hopefully be made available soon. Good luck!
